* lfe-mode
[[https://melpa.org/#/lfe-mode][file:https://melpa.org/packages/lfe-mode-badge.svg]]

** Installation
=lfe-mode= can be installed from [[https://melpa.org][MELPA]]:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x package-install RET lfe-mode RET
#+END_EXAMPLE

Or, if you're like me and have a local copy of [[https://github.com/rvirding/lfe][lfe]]:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar lfe-dir (concat (getenv "HOME") "/path/to/lfe/emacs"))

(add-to-list 'load-path lfe-dir)

(require 'lfe-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Configuration
*** Hooks
Personally, I like [[https://melpa.org/#/paredit][paredit]], [[https://melpa.org/#/rainbow-delimiters][rainbow-delimiters]] and [[https://melpa.org/#/auto-complete][auto-complete]], but the same
strategy applies for any hook you might want.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(dolist (func '(paredit-mode rainbow-delimiters-mode auto-complete-mode))
  (add-hook 'lfe-mode-hook func))
#+END_SRC

*** Indentation
=lfe-mode= includes and indentation helper function, inspired by the one in
[[https://melpa.org/#/clojure-mode][clojure-mode]], =define-lfe-indent=. A number of core forms already have
indentation rules, but often you might want to define your own, for a custom
function or for modified handling of a core form.

For example, here are some indentation rules I define in [[https://github.com/yurrriq/dotfiles/blob/emacs/lisp/init-lfe.el][my =.emacs=]] for working
with [[https://github.com/lfex/exemplar][exemplar]].
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-lfe-indent
  ;; exemplar
  (body    0)
  (div     1)
  (div     'defun)
  (head    0)
  (html    'defun)
  (link-to 1)
  (pre     1)
  (span    'defun)
  (ul      0))
#+END_SRC

N.B. I have quite a few local changes to my Emacs config that have yet to make
it to GitHub, but I'll try to push soon.

**** Tasks
***** TODO Update my [[https://github.com/yurrriq/dotfiles/blob/emacs/lisp/init-lfe.el][LFE-related dotfiles]] on GitHub
